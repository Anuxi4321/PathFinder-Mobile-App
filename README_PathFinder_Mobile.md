# PathFinder Mobile

PathFinder Mobile is the companion app for the PathFinder Smart Cart system. It allows users to create, manage, and sync their shopping lists to a smart cart in real time.

## Features

- Create and manage shopping lists
- Browse store catalog
- Sync shopping list to the cart via QR code
- Persistent shopping list storage
- Modern and user-friendly Flutter interface

## Tech Stack

- **Flutter**: Frontend framework
- **SQLite**: Local database for storing shopping lists
- **HTTP**: Communication with the cart via local Flask server
- **QR Code**: Used for syncing list with the shopping cart

## Sync Workflow

1. Cart displays a QR code (generated by the Flask server).
2. User scans the QR code using PathFinder Mobile.
3. Mobile app sends the shopping list to the cart.
4. Cart receives the list and begins guiding the user.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Flutter dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run the app:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

4. Ensure your device is on the same network as the cart to sync successfully.

## Project Structure

- `lib/screens`: All UI screens (Home, Sync, Catalog, etc.)
- `lib/widgets`: Custom widgets for shopping list, catalog, QR scanner
- `lib/data`: Handles local storage and database functions

## To Do / Future Improvements

- User authentication
- Real-time cart tracking in-app
- Enhanced catalog filters
- Multi-store support
